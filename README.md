# Hi, I'm Daniel 👋

I'm currently learning programming with Python and game development.  
I’m deeply interested in artificial intelligence, and with the help of ChatGPT, I’ve started building some exciting personal projects.

Even though I’m still a beginner, I’ve already created a Discord bot, a Rust game bot, Rust plugins, and set up my own Ubuntu server on DigitalOcean.  
All my projects are made with a passion to learn — and yes, they might have bugs, but each mistake is part of the journey. I'm a self-taught learner with no official degree, because I prefer to follow my own path.
